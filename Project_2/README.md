# ENPM_661 Project 2
# Dijkstra implementation on a mobile robot

#Dijkstra on a point Robot

Maximum time taken to explore all nodes and generate the shortest path - 160 seconds

1) Run the code Djikstra_point_robot.py
2) Enter 1 to select the Goal and Start point by clicking on the image
   Enter 2 to manually enter the Goal and Start Node
   
   If you Enter 1, click on the image displayed twice to choose the Start and Goal coordinate where you want
   If you Enter 2,e nter the coordinates for Start and Goal node manually
  For example, 
  Enter x coordinates for the Start point : 5
  Enter y coordinates for the Start point : 5
  Enter x coordinates for the Goal point : 295
  Enter x coordinates for the Goal point : 195
  
3) Wait till the path gets generated
4) The cost for the robot from the Start node till the Goal node will be displayed along with the animation.


#Dijkstra on a Rigid robot

Maximum time taken to explore all nodes and generate the shortest path - 120 seconds

1) Run the code Djikstra_rigid_robot.py
2) Enter the Radius of the Robot
3) Enter the Clearance for the Robot from the obstacle
